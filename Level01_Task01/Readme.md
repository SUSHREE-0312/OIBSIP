# Burger Bar - Landing Page

This repository contains the landing page for "Burger Bar," a visually engaging and responsive web page designed as part of my Web Development and Design Internship (Level 1, Task 01). The landing page is crafted using HTML, CSS, and integrated with Font Awesome for added iconography. The goal was to create a modern, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing webpage with various elements and animations.

   - Interactive hover effects, underlining, and a color change for active links.

   - A bold hero section featuring a striking headline, a catchy tagline, and two call-to-action buttons ("Order Now" and "View More").

### 4. **Image Carousel**
   - A collection of burger images presented in a carousel-like layout at the bottom of the page.
   - Interactive elements such as hover effects and an auto-rotating burger display.

### 5. **Animations and Effects**
   - Custom animations and transitions using CSS keyframes to enhance the user experience.
   - Smooth fades, slides, and scaling effects are used for elements such as the navigation bar, text, buttons, and images.

### 6. **JavaScript Interactivity**
   - A custom JavaScript function is used to generate a starry background, adding a unique visual element to the page.
   - Interactive burger image toggle, allowing users to view different burger images upon click.
